This is my first full-stack project.
I use HTML, CSS, JavaScript for frontend.
Nodejs, Expressjs, ejs for backend.
For database I use MongoDB.
I used cloudnary for store images.
Cloudnary is good for stornig images.
I used Authentication at this project.
This project is great for use frontend or backend.
During my backend classes I created this.
In deployment I faced issues.

Then I felt stuck but taking time I resolve the error.
When yiu solve error then wow.
